Project Name: X-ray Monitor

Team: Georgia Davidson (developer and user)

Scope: elicit radiologists’ X-ray readings and return an agent to help them read and detect bone fractures more accurately and effectively

User stories: 
-As the developer, I want to diagnose which fractures scanned by X-rays are likely to appear ambiguous or even go undetected, in order to determine which will need to be fixed for better, more 
accurate detecting.  
-As the user, I want to know which X-rays are having issues and focus on making the data from them as accurate as possible, classifying patients as having or not having a fracture with a 90% accuracy 
or greater. 

Requirements:

-preprocess data with Keras in Python
-create neural networks for classification and train models on training data subset
-test neural network models on test data subset and compare their performance metrics


Priorities:

-must be able to classify patients as having a bone fracture or not with 90% accuracy or greater given an X-ray image of their injury
-must be able to filter fractures by type (hip, hand, etc)
-must optimize models with KerasTuner if accuracy is less than 90%
